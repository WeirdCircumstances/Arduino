This is a C++ library intended to be used to simplify code generated by the MakerVision
Scratch for Arduino IDE, available online at http://makervision.io

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install this library, just place this entire folder as a subfolder in your
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries folder.

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this library is installed, you just have to start the Arduino application.
You may see a few warning messages as it's built.

To use this library in a sketch, go to the Sketch | Import Library menu and
select MakerVision.  This will add a corresponding line to the top of your sketch:
#include <MVServo.h>

To stop using this library, delete that line from your sketch.
