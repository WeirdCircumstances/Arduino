# gbs-control

This project provides presets and control software for Tvia Trueview5725 based video converter boards.
These boards are a cost efficient way to adapt legacy game consoles to modern displays.

Gbs-control replaces the original control software and better optimizes the Trueview5725 multimedia processor for the task of upscaling "240p" 15kHz content.

It is a continuation of previous work by dooklink, mybook4, Ian Stedman and others.
